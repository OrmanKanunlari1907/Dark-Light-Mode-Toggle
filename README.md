# Dark-Light-Mode-Toggle
Super simple AppleScript Application to quickly switch from dark mode to light mode and vice versa for Macs. This application is not signed so Gatekeeper will not be happy. Please go into System Settings to enable the application.

I have only tested on 15.4 Sequoia but I assume it should work with any MacOS version with Dark mode (MacOS 10.14+).
I reccomend having this application in your dock to quickly switch from Dark Mode to Light Mode. As a power user, I like to switch between the two depending on the environment I am in.
Enjoy ï£¿
